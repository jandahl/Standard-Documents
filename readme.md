# Bare minimum standard documents

So you want to work with production environments in IT?

Well, EVERY place should have some process documents and most places don't, so here I am aiming to make the "bare minimum standard boilerplate documents".

The motto here is 

### "It's not much but it's slightly better than nothing"

## Change Request

You need to document changes and why you want to make them.

## Manifesto

[You should internalize this](https://github.com/rucarrol/Manifesto)

## Post Mortems

When something goes wrong you want to make sure you learn from it, and of course you share what you have learned and document it for future reference, right?
