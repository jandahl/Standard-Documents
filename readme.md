# Bare minimum standard documents

So you want to work with production environments in IT?

Well, EVERY place should have some process documents and most places don't, so here I am aiming to make the "bare minimum standard boilerplate documents".

The motto here is 

### "It's not much but it's slightly better than nothing"

## Change Request

You need to document changes and why you want to make them.
